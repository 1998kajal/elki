<p>KDD-Framework is a generic framework for a broad range of KDD-applications
and their development.</p>

<h1>Architecture</h1>
<!-- // TODO : describe architecture (some diagrams?) -->

<h2>How to make use of this framework</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>To use the KDD-Framework we recommend an executable .jar-file:
<a href="../executable/elki.jar">elki.jar</a>. You get a description of usage by calling
<code>java -jar elki.jar -h</code>.
You may find some older <a href="../archive">executable versions</a> in our archive.</p>

<h3>Development of new applications</h3>

<h4>Extension</h4>
To provide new applications one is simply to implement the specified interfaces.
There are interfaces for a broad range of targets of development. Compare the
<a href="overview-tree.html">tree of interfaces</a> to get an overview
concerning the provided interfaces.


<h4>Where are what parameters used for which purpose?</h4>

<p>The main class {@link de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.KDDTask KDDTask} requires specification of an
{@link de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.algorithm.Algorithm Algorithm}
to use, a {@link de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.database.connection.DatabaseConnection DatabaseConnection} to manage the input,
and a filename where to deploy the output. However, by omitting specification of a filename for
output, the results will be given to standard output, thus it may be piped directly to another
application.</p>

<p>Furthermore a normalization can be specified for the input.
You can additionally require to restore the original values for the output.</p>

<p>Which input is to be provided in what way
is to be defined via parameters specifically for a certain
{@link de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.database.connection.DatabaseConnection DatabaseConnection}.</p>

<p>The need for other parameters may differ from implementation to implementation. However,
you need not to specify input nor output if you are going to implement an algorithm.</p>
