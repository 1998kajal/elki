/**
 * <p>Package to collect algorithms for clustering in axis-parallel subspaces, suitable as a task for the {@link de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.KDDTask} main routine.</p>
 * 
 * The clustering algorithms in this package are instances of both, projected clustering algorithms or
 * subspace clsutering algorithms according to the classical but somewhat obsolete classification schema
 * of clustering algorithms for axis-parallel subspaces.
