/**
 * Parallel processing core for ELKI.
 * 
 * Parallel processing is a tricky topic on its own.
 * ELKI will probably not be able to provide the ultimate parallel processing architecture,
 * and this package aims at providing some basic functionality that allows at least naive
 * parallelization of popular data mining algorithms.
