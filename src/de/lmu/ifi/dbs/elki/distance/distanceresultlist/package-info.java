/**
 * <p>Classes for building and storing the results of distance-based queries</p>
 * 
 * <p>The classes in this package essentially form three groups:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.database.ids.distance.KNNHeap} for <b>building kNN results</b>.
 * It allows adding new candidates (and loses old candidates automatically), but it is not iterable.<br />
 * To get an instance, use {@link de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.distance.distanceresultlist.KNNUtil#newHeap}!
 * </li>
 * <li>{@link de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.database.ids.distance.KNNList} is the <b>final kNN result</b>
 * obtained by serializing a heap via {@link de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.database.ids.distance.KNNHeap#toKNNList}.
 * It is iterable and totally ordered, but can no longer be modified.</li>
 * <li>{@link de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.database.ids.generic.GenericDistanceDBIDList} and the optimized
 * counterpart {@link de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.database.ids.distance.DoubleDistanceDBIDPairList}, are
 * <b>modifiable, but not necessarily sorted</b> lists of neighbors, useful for example for range queries.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>Try to choose the most appropriate one! Heaps are optimized for updates but bad for reading,
 * KNNResult is optimized for reading but unmodifiable, and the lists are easy to modify,
 * but less efficient than heaps.</p>
 *
